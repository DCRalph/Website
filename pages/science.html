        <h2>Disease 1: Covid 19</h2>
        <p>
          Coronavirus is part of a large family of viruses which may cause illness in humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
          <br><br>

            <h2>Movement</h2>
            <p>
              Coronavirus will make it harder to breathe. This means that you will not be able to move as much because you can not get oxygen into your blood fast enough.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Respiration</h2>
            <p>
              Respiration will be harder because it will be harder to get oxygen into the lungs.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
            <p>
              There is a myth that coronavirus can cause you to lose your sense of smell. However there is no scientific evedence proving this.
            </dp>

            <br>

            <h2>Growth</h2>
            <p>
              Coronavirus can grow and reproduce very quickly very fast this is why it is such a big problem.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Reproduction</h2>
            <p>
              Coronavirus can reproduce easily in the human body. This is how it spreads very fast.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Excretion</h2>
            <p>
              Cronavirus does not affect excretion.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>
              Cronavirus can make your mouth dry up and make it uncomfortable to eat and drink.
            </p>

            <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Environmental factors</h2>
        <p>
          Coronavirus thrives in a lot of places. For example coronavirus can live on a steel table for up to 28 days. They can survive from 4ºC to 70ºC.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>How to combat it</h2>
        <p>
          Coronavirus is only spread through human contact, direct or non direct. It is very simple to stop the spread of coronavirus just don't have human contact and wash your hands often. The chance of contracting it can be minimised by not touching door knobs, flat surfaces and things that other people touch regularly and then touching your face.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          Cronavirus is quite new so we don't know everything about it yet. But we do know how it spreads and how to stop it. People are not listening to the experts and that is the reason that it has spread very fast.

        <h2>Disease 2: Ebola</h2>
        <p>
          Ebola is a deadly disease with occasional outbreaks that occur primarily on the African continent. Ebola most commonly affects people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees).
