        <h2>Teams dont work so I do it here.</h2>

        <br>

        <h2>Task</h2>
        <p>
          This research activity requires you to investigate biological ideas related to how humans are affected by TWO different types of pathogens. The pathogens are disease causing micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi or viruses.

        </p>

        <h2>Disease 1: Covid 19</h2>
        <p>
          Coronavirus is part of a large family of viruses which may cause illness in humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
          <br><br>

          <h2>Section 2 - MSGREN</h2>
            <h2>Movement</h2>
            <p>
              Coronavirus will make it harder to breathe. This means that you will not be able to move as much because you can not get oxygen into your blood fast enough.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Respiration</h2>
            <p>
              Respiration will be harder because it will be harder to get oxygen into the lungs.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
            <p>
              There is a myth that coronavirus can cause you to lose your sense of smell. However there is no scientific evedence proving this.
            </dp>

            <br>

            <h2>Growth</h2>
            <p>
              Coronavirus can grow and reproduce very quickly very fast this is why it is such a big problem.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Reproduction</h2>
            <p>
              Coronavirus can reproduce easily in the human body. This is how it spreads very fast.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Excretion</h2>
            <p>
              Cronavirus does not affect excretion.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>
              Cronavirus can make your mouth dry up and make it uncomfortable to eat and drink.
            </p>

            <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Section 3 - Environmental factors</h2>
        <p>
          Coronavirus thrives in a lot of places. For example coronavirus can live on a steel table for up to 28 days. They can survive from 4ºC to 70ºC.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Section 4 - How to combat it</h2>
        <p>
          Coronavirus is only spread through human contact, direct or non direct. It is very simple to stop the spread of coronavirus just don't have human contact and wash your hands often. The chance of contracting it can be minimised by not touching door knobs, flat surfaces and things that other people touch regularly and then touching your face.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Section 5 - Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          Cronavirus is quite new so we don't know everything about it yet. But we do know how it spreads and how to stop it. People are not listening to the experts and that is the reason that it has spread very fast.
        </p>

        <h2>Disease 2: Ebola</h2>
        <p>
          Ebola is a deadly disease with occasional outbreaks that occur primarily on the African continent. Ebola most commonly affects people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees).
          <br><br>

          <h2>Section 2 - MSGREN</h2>
          <h2>Movement</h2>
          <p>
            Ebola attacks all organs in the body and this stops you from being able to move around.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Respiration</h2>
          <p>
            Ebola attacks your lungs and can limit the amount of breathing you can do. That can stop the oxygen from getting to your brain.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
          <p>
            Ebola attacks the immune system and disables it. The body can not fight it off by itself.
          </dp>

          <br>

          <h2>Growth</h2>
          <p>
            Ebola does not effect your growth.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Reproduction</h2>
          <p>
            Ebola can affect reproduction by getting to the reproductive organs. Once it is in it can be spread.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Excretion</h2>
          <p>
            Ebola does not effect your excretion.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Nutrition</h2>
          <p>
            Ebola starts with a flu-like syndrome, fever and profound weakness which may initially appear 2 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. The Ebola virus is in breast milk and cases of infants of breastfeeding mothers contracting ebola have been noted.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Environmental factors</h2>
          <p>
            A number of environmental factors influence the spread of communicable diseases that are prone to cause epidemics. The most important of these are: <br>
            - water supply <br>
            - sanitation facilities <br>
            - food <br>
            - climate <br>
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Section 4 - How to combat it</h2>
          <p>
            Prevention focuses on avoiding contact with the viruses. The following precautions can help prevent infection and spread of Ebola and Marburg.<br>
            - Avoid areas of known outbreaks <br>
            - Wash your hands frequently. <br>
            - Avoid bush meat <br>
            - Avoid contact with infected people <br>
            - Follow infection-control procedures <br>
            - Don't handle remains <br><br>

          </p>
